# Synthetic-Image-Generation-using-DCGAN
Synthetic data is system-generated data that mimics real data in terms of essential parameters set by the user.  

* The motivation behind Synthetic data generation *  

The main reasons why synthetic data is used instead of real data are cost, privacy, and testing. Producing synthetic data through a generation model is significantly more cost-effective and efficient than collecting real-world data. This especially applies to the autonomous vehicle space where real-world data can be both time-consuming and costly to collect. 

How is synthetic data generated?  
Synthetic data can be created by stripping any personal information (eg: - names, license plates,..) from a real dataset so it is completely anonymized. Another method is to create a generative model from the original dataset that produces synthetic data that closely resembles the authentic data. A generative model is a model that can learn from large, real datasets to ensure the data it produces accurately resembles real-world data.
